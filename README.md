#Defoliation
##Introduction
Defoliation is my first project after I worked, it is used for generating a MS-word file with a kind of template with specific information. Defoliation can copy template from a source MS-word file, insert some specific information in the template, gather these templates with different information in one MS-word file. 
##Notice
1. My English is not good enough, some wrong words spelling, bad grammar sentences or confused semantics may include in my narrative. You are welcome to prompt me where I am wrong, if you are glad to do. Thank you! 
2. Defoliation is still not finished, I researched and wrote this project in my privacy exercise project in past, and it could completely copy word information (texts, tables, pictures, equations) and styles, and I will move these codes recently.
